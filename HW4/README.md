My partners for this assignment were Riley and Adam. Given we each started the assignment at different times and took on different appoaches, 
I mainly consulted them with the methodology, and we eached coded at our own paces. 

Two method in ruptures were taking too long to plot, given they were computationally costly, so those plots are not included. 

After trying to change up appoache in the MCMC NB, some of the modeling began to fail, and I haven't figured out a fix. 

ALso, github repo still wont allow me to push from colab.
