Offical partners; Riley and Adam 

I did most of the work independtly. I did discuss concepts with Dr. Bianco, and Riley. 
I also referred to youtube videos that explained the DTW method conceptually.
I did refer to Riley for sanity check on number, which was how I figured something needed to be fixed in my algorithm.
